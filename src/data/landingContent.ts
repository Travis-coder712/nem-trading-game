    heading: 'Welcome to the NEM',
    body: "The **National Electricity Market** is one of the world's longest interconnected power systems, spanning **5 regions** across eastern Australia: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. It serves over 10 million customers and trades approximately **200 TWh** of electricity annually.",

    heading: 'How the Market Works',
    body: "Every **5 minutes**, generators submit bids to AEMO (Australian Energy Market Operator) offering to supply electricity at various prices. AEMO dispatches the cheapest generation first to meet demand. The price paid by all generators is set by the **last (most expensive) unit dispatched** \u2014 this is called the **clearing price** or spot price.",
  },
  {
    icon: '📈',
    heading: 'The Merit Order',
    body: "Bids are stacked from lowest to highest price \u2014 this is the **merit order**. Renewables (wind, solar) typically bid at **$0** since their fuel is free. Coal bids around **$25\u201345/MWh**, gas at **$65\u2013160/MWh**. The merit order determines which generators run and which sit idle. Cheaper plants run more often; expensive plants only run when demand is high.",
  },
  {
    icon: '💰',
    heading: 'Clearing Price & Uniform Pricing',
    body: "The key insight: **ALL dispatched generators receive the same clearing price**, regardless of their bid. If demand requires a gas peaker bidding at $150/MWh, then coal plants that bid $30/MWh also receive $150/MWh. This means **infra-marginal generators** (those below the clearing price) earn significant profits. Your goal: maximise your profit by bidding strategically.",
  },
  {
    icon: '🏭',
    heading: 'Generator Types',
    body: "**Coal** \u2014 Large baseload plants, low cost ($25\u201345), slow to start/stop.\n**Gas CCGT** \u2014 Mid-merit, moderate cost ($65\u201385), flexible.\n**Gas Peaker** \u2014 Fast start, high cost ($120\u2013160), runs only at peak times.\n**Hydro** \u2014 Very flexible, low cost ($8), but limited water supply.\n**Wind & Solar** \u2014 Zero fuel cost, but output depends on weather.\n**Battery** \u2014 Charge when cheap, discharge when expensive. Arbitrage profit.",

    heading: 'Understanding Costs',
    body: "**SRMC (Short Run Marginal Cost)** is the cost to generate one additional MWh. It includes fuel and variable O&M but NOT capital costs. Bidding at SRMC covers your costs \u2014 anything above SRMC is profit. The game shows each asset\u2019s SRMC with a **coloured badge** so you always know your break-even price.",

Coal plants are **retiring** (Liddell 2023, Eraring planned 2025). **Renewables** now provide over 35% of NEM generation. **Batteries** are emerging as the new flexible capacity. This creates new market dynamics: the **duck curve**, **negative prices**, and increased **volatility** \u2014 all of which you\u2019ll experience in this game.",
