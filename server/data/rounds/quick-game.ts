Battery charging opportunity?\n🌅 **Morning**: Industry starting up, solar ramping. With an outage, supply is tighter.\n☀️ **Afternoon**: Peak summer demand. Solar helps but some capacity is out. Will prices spike?\n🌆 **Evening**: The crunch. Solar cliff + sustained heat + outage = maximum stress. Every MW earns premium.\n\nThe team with the highest cumulative profit across all 8 rounds wins!',
